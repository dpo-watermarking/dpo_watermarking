The scene opens in London on a foggy, smoggy day. The city is in a "mortifying and sinking frame." The fog has made everything look "like a thick and stinking mass." The Queen is worried that Buckingham will resign, but she doesn't know how to tell Buckingham. She also doesn't know how to get rid of him, and so she sits "quiet and in despair." Buckingham enters as the fog is clearing. He confesses that he's unhappy. He's also in debt, and he wants to borrow some money. The Queen refuses his loan until he pa
Caddy Jellyby has spent the night in Esther and Ada's room, sleeping near Esther in a fit of despair. At dawn, she wakes up to find her sisters and father outside her room. They have all heard that Caddy Jellyby has gone to the river to try and get back to the boat. They have also heard that she is struggling to get back to the boat. Her sisters and father ask if she is alright. She is pale, but answers that she is not afraid. They ask why she ran away, and she says that she wants to go home. The girls are 
Esther and Mr. Jarndyce discuss the Chancery suit, and Esther leans that it is a hopeless muddle, and anything left of the great fortune disputed within it has been consumed by legal. The narrator comments that in the event of a successful suit Esther will be compelled to take a more subordinate position, but that she will have her choice, since the suit is unlikely to succeed. Mr. Beebe arrives with news that the chancery suit is now in the hands of Joshua Neligan. He offers to take Mr. Beebe on a tour of 
Tulkinghorn and Krook find Nemo dead, apparently from an overdose of opium. They're shocked to learn that he's been dead almost a year. They bury him, but it's not enough. A mouse finds Nemo's body, and it's infected with the plague. Everyone dies except for the mouse, who stays behind to help the others. The others are voracious eaters, but they're also infected. They burn the mouse with a bonfire, but the worms come out of its bones and eat it. The worms are devoured too, and everyone is sick. The poison 
Richard leaves to start his studies. Lucy is left alone with George. He tells her that he will not be coming to Meryton for the winter, and is instead going to the university in Oxford. Lucy is sad, but excited by this change of plans. She feels that he is leaving her behind as he is going off to university. George comments that he is leaving because he has heard that she is engaged - to a Latin professor. It turns out that he has heard correctly; she is engaged to someone else. The two of them are not happ
In Chapter 18, Richard begins at Kenge and Carboy's. He goes to the inn where Mr. Kenge has been let off by the landlord. There, he meets a woman named Hannah, who is looking for him. He asks her where he is wanted. She tells him that he is wanted for murder. Richard confesses to throwing the dead body of his brother out of the window in order to get away from him. He says that he will never admit to what he did. Hannah says that if he is alive, she will be his wife. Richard is shocked to hear that she is p
Chapter 19 takes place in the summertime in London, during the "long vacation" of the court. The king is on his way to France with a group of diplomats and officials. When he arrives at the palace, he has dinner alone with Queen Anne. She is waiting for him. The queen is totally in love with the king; she can't believe it when he leaves and comes back. She wants to know what's up with the king. The queen is worried that the king's love will make the king take an alternate wife, since the queen is sure that 
Continuing in London during the long vacation, Mr. Eager and Mr. Thrush are soon seen together for the first time. He becomes sad at their separation and asks Thrush to visit him often. Thrush visits him often and spends a lot of time talking with him. Therefore, Eager is not surprised when Thrush inevitably grows attached to him. Thrush then tells Eager that he has become so attached to him that he cannot go home. He will stay in London for another two months. He visits Thrush often during this time. Howev
Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Esther return to Bleak House, leaving Lincolnshire and Mr. Boythorn's house. Esther didn't have any more meetings with Lady Dedlock, except to see her in church. Back at. Osborn's house, she finds some of his papers. She also notices that his house is very dull and that he has left it without any of the furniture he took from Bleak House. He has also left a lot of money for his children, but all he has left for her is twenty pounds. The next day, she decides to visit the Stilles. She 
At the shooting gallery, Phil Squod explains to his master, Mr. Eager, that a man and a woman - two members of the extremely rare "Eager Group" - just entered. Mr. Eager asks if he means the Man and the Woman. Mr. Eager tells him that's what he's talking about. He then goes on to describe the group, which he describes as consisting of three men and one woman. That's when Fix comes in. Fix is up to his usual tricks, and he tells Mr. Eager about the strange man and woman who entered the room earlier. The man 
Mrs. Woodcourt comes to stay at Bleak House for three weeks. Esther has a troubling encounter with her: she is rather insulted, though she pretends not to be, by the old lady's. She tells Fanny that she thought of marrying Mr. Rochester but was too proud and so she now lives in a dusty little cottage at the end of the road. She says that her life is unhappy and that she feels like a "murderer." Mrs. Woodcourt is living in misery and "wretchedness" as well. But Fanny thinks it is a good thing that she is so 
The story of Krook's death and the aftermath continues. The narrative shifts to a third person, a man named Peter. Peter is a poor farmhand who has no education. He has a habit of taking odd jobs and going away for long periods of time. During one of these periods, he happens to be in charge of a Swedish sauna. One day, a woman named Esther saw him outside and followed him. She later found out that he had been a servant at her own father's house. Esther had given him bad directions and had also stolen money
Esther and Charley visit Boythorn's house while he is London. Boythorn is surprised to see them, and they talk about news. Boythorn remembers that he said that he would bring a couple of girls from London to fight Lydgate if he ever caught him in the parish. He remembers how much Esther admired his strength and courage when he was fighting Lydgate. Boythorn also tells Charley about the fight he had with Lydgate. He admits he was a little afraid of Lydgate at that time, but points out that Lydgate has since 
Chapter 40 concerns itself with the Parliamentary elections, which appear to be going more towards Mr. Bhaer's party than the Nationalist Party. The elections are due in March, and the Bhaerites are trying to organize the parliamentary campaign as well as possible. Bhaer goes to see the Grand Duke, who is still in Florence. He tells him about the situation in Austria, where Nuremburg is being oppressed by the Cardinal's enforcer, the Duke of Buckingham. The Grand Duke hopes that the situation will get bette
Chapter 42 brings Tulkinghorn back to London, where he converses with Snagsby. They talk about the loss of Bulstrode, and the expulsion of his tenants by the people who lived in the house before they did. The conversation turns to the battle in France. Having been captured himself, Tulkinghorn asks Snagsby to tell Regan how he escaped. Snagsby says that he was led away by a woman who looked like Madame Bonacieux. He remembers that she made him promise not to tell anyone about his capture. The woman took him
Though Esther desperately wants to speak to or to write to her mother, she doesn't dare, for fear of ruining her. So she just writes. Hannah, on the other hand, is determined to get a letter out to her sisters, and does her best to be cheerful. She even prays to God to help her write. When her second try doesn't succeed, she tries again. This time, she gets a response from Hannah, who writes to her saying that she understands her anxiety. Hannah writes to her about how she would like to come and visit her s

One afternoon, Mr. Wakem, one of the men who works at the mill, comes to Jo's room to tell her that his wife is coming to see her.

In a long passage, Inspector Bucket informs Sir Leicester Dedlock that his wife is suspected of the murder of Tulkinghorn. Sir Leicester has a nice show of force at his disposal to secure his wife's arrest. He commands that Inspector Bucket be arrested. The two men fight. Sir Leicester's bad-tempered, and he fights back; they fight on the stairs of the House of the Seven Gables. Sir Leicester drops his sword. Inspector Bucket takes off his coat and reveals his identity. His name is Armado, and he is totally
Bucket and Esther search in vain for Lady Dedlock. They've found her old letter, and the old woman is all warmed up about the prospect of meeting her. But that's not enough. She's also looking for a picture of Captain Vye, an old friend of hers. We learn that Vye is a very wealthy man--he has a mansion, a library, a gym, and, crucially, a lot of men who like to look at his pictures. Esther and Bucket are puzzled by this. Why would he need these things? Well, we're guessing that Vye's a gentleman. He lives i
In Chapter 61, Esther is visting Ada daily, and is hugely concerned about the young couple. She knows that they will grow old married and perhaps have children. She wonders whether her own life would have been better if she had stayed in Germany. She worries that Mr. Lorry will die someday, when he is very old. She is very depressed. When this occurs, she goes to see her friends at the seaside. She tells them about her sorrows and hopes that they can help her. They have all suffered the same fate. Her hope 
The next morning, prompted by Allan's confession and her own fear of her feelings, Esther tells Jarndyce that she will be the mistress of Bleak House "when he pleases. She adds that, if he does not please her, she will take the house and leave him. She could not bear to keep Bleak House a secret from him. One day, when she is in the middle of her work in the garden, she sees a man coming towards her. She hides behind a bush and waits for him to pass. He comes close and, seeing her, laughs in her face. He tu
Mr. Jarndyce goes to Yorkshire to see Allan Woodcourt. Soon he invites Esther to join them. He has settled Allan in a new "Bleak House." Upon seeing Esther's face when she reads... Mr. Jarndyce asks her if she knows the story of Shallow and his horse. She does not. She assumes that he means the Shallow and his horse, but she is not sure. He is very excited to hear about Shallow and his horse, and tells her that he has forgotten his name. He asks her to say his name again, and she does. He tells her that the
Right away the gloves come off with the third-person narrator. The narrator's just waiting around until someone, or something, comes along and saves him. Or, you know, he could have just waited until someone, or something, came along and saved him. Anyway, the narrator is in a hurry. He's got business to attend to, and he's got to get back to it quickly. So it's out of the way that he'll be a companion to Lady Chiltern. Mr. Irwine seems happy about this arrangement. He's a sucker for a good woman, after all
Still the third-person narrator. A gypsy woman visits the gypsy girl. She has a baby and cries when she is bottle-fed. She is also fond of the baby's crying, and tries to nurse it. The gypsy woman's husband returns from the market, looking for his wife. He is angry that she is with the travelers, but he does not wish to quarrel with them so he embraces them. The gypsy woman gives birth to a stillborn child to the travelers' delight, then flees the town. The husband and wife try to reconcile, but he cannot g
Whoa, total about-face as we flip into the voice of a first-person narrator, Esther. First, she's talking to her father. And he's very worried. He's worried that his little daughter - who still seems pretty darn young to us - is going to get into some trouble, and he's worried about losing her. What? Whoa, OK, Dad. Maybe a little reality check would help. The narrator then shifts back to Esther and describes the scene in her house, where she's reading a book. She looks up, and suddenly sees a bunch of peopl
Kenge tells the gang that since Jarndyce's place is far away, they'll be spending the night at Mrs. Flint's place. The next day they leave for Mrs. Flint's place. On the way, Steerforth tells his friends about his dream of being a knight and fighting in a Crusaders-style battle against the Saxons. They all laugh at him, but he insists. That night they camp out at Mrs. Flint's place. Julia sees a strange figure in the moonlight. It's the ghost of Mrs. Flint, who has been talking to Steerforth. She asks him w
The next morning the gang wakes up totally freezing in the horrible Jellyby house. The house has been on the market for weeks and no one has ever bought it. It's funny to think that the only person who has ever seen the house is Mr. Peggotty. Luckily, the gang is not too worried about the house as they had a hot night the night before. They decide to spend the day in London before heading back to Bristol. They find some money in a chest in the travel chest and decide they will go to the bank to get money. W
OK, so the troupe gets the heck out of Dodge, and with every mile out of the city the weather looks nicer and the outdoors greener and more pleasant. The men set out on their journey---to vague and unfamiliar lands. We're not sure why anyone would want to go all the way out to the middle of the desert, but they do. As they travel on, they see a collection of strange villages and strange people. They never seem to grow any taller than the men who inhabit them, and they have no roads or railroads or washing m
It's raining cats and dogs in the world's least pleasant place to be, Chesney Wold, the Dedlocks' estate. And what a group of sad, pathetic old men they are. Now they want to build a new road through the forest, which will make the place "more pleasant." Excuse me? What is this? A green light for the mobs to come? Well, I'm not going to be stopped. Because I'm here to tell you that the place is already "more pleasant" than it has ever been, thanks to the new road. The road, by the way, will not be built thr
So it's only been one night, but Esther is totally settling into her new digs. She's sleeping soundly and eating regularly. Without any of the weird things that Sarah had to deal with in her room, she's enjoying herself thoroughly. And she's also getting to know her new neighbors, the Hirschlings. Mr. Harling seems to be a really nice guy. He's a doctor and he's all about treating people. So far, so good. The narrator gives us a little history of the town of Gopher Prairie. It used to be a very big prairie 
Esther apologizes for spending so much time talking about herself. Mr. Lorry agrees with her. He tells Lestrade to let the real criminal go free. He says that his conscience is clear. He also warns that the fake person may try to kill Lestrade. He says that he's saved the best part of his day for last. They exit as the sun rises and the night begins. The doorbell rings and the butler comes in. The butler says that it's morning and someone is at the house. It's not a visitor, though, it's a messenger. The bu
New people coming through. I'm trying to get an idea of what this place is like. Anyone have any experience here? Any thoughts? Thanks. Great thread btw. Everyone is so cool. I'm trying to be like them. Any tips? Thanks. We all go here at least once. I see what people are saying about the hookah, but I have never seen it used for hookah. I think we just have a few people who use it for that. I don't even know what it is. I really want to try it, but I don't really know where to go. Any ideas? Thanks. Bye. I
OK, we'll stop beating around the bus - the dude is dead. Jim takes off with the body, but is stopped by a guy carrying a bloody stump. Stump says it's not his - it's a guy who was hanging around with the pirates. The guy with the stump is a fake Captain Flint - he's just there to stir up trouble. We'll never really know whether or not Jim is actually Captain Flint. He does, however, take the body back to the inn as the other pirates look on in horror. As for the body, it's gone. Jim is totally messed up. H
The Dedlocks are coming back to Chesney Wold from Paris. They tell Fagin that they will be staying in the village for a few days until they can find a way home. The news about Nancy's kidnapping has spread rapidly through the village and people are anxious. There is not much that the Dedlocks can say about their daughter's whereabouts, but they do tell Fagin that they do not think that Nancy has been kidnapped at all. Fagin, however, believes that Nancy has run away from her family and believes that she mig
The Bleak House gang is hard at work trying to figure out a career for Richard. They think he's a good guy, but they aren't entirely convinced. Richard decides to hold out for a job with the church. He's not sure he wants to stay with the Squire. The gang is excited to hear that Richard will be staying around. They all decide to go to dinner together at the Bleak House. Mr. Milton is always up for an excuse to hang out with his friends, and he invites them to his house. Mrs. Alving is still pretty bitter ab
Before Richard sets off to the Badger college of doctor knowledge, he and Ada talk about the Chancery suit. Ada is worried that he's been corrupted by the immoral townspeople who live around him. The bad people in town are mean and uncouth, but they're not all bad. In fact, they seem to have good morals. For example, they've got the Midas touch--they're always doing well, whether they're a merchant or a soldier. Richard is impressed by their self-control. He tells Ada that she shouldn't be too hard on the t
OK, guys, this chapter is kind of hardcore. The first part of it is actually a long discussion about morality, and the second part is a rant about how ignorant and superficial everyone has been about the whole "religion" thing. So start reading at your own pace - there are definitely a lot of important moments. But first we'll go over our opening line: "The Lord's name is in the power of the tongue, and everyone who loves it will eat his bread. Everyone who hates it will drink poison." Translation: anyone w
Lady Dedlock is bored and restless. She's had her day, and she'd like to have more. Lady Chiltern suggests that she go visit the Hardinge house. Mrs. Hardinge, we're told, is a very nice lady who really loves her family and her house. She'll be happy to see Lady Chiltern, if only for that. But Lady Chiltern is not interested in visiting the Hardinge house. She's on a mission, and home isn't it. Mrs. Hardinge asks why. Lady Chiltern says it's because she's heard a lot of talk about the house lately. Lady Chi
Richard's not doing too well at Mr. Peggotty's house. He's still upset about Emily, so he heads over to the Peggotty house for some solitude. He finds Mr. Peggotty sitting alone, wearing a "different" suit than usual. Mr. Peggotty, instead of saying that he's decided to stay in the country, is actually giving himself up to nature. He's been watching the passing seasons with his telescope. The weather hasn't been too good for sightseeing, so he's happy to just sit and enjoy the seasons. Then he asks Mr. Pegg
Oh, Richard, Richard, Richard. We wish we could buy a dozen, just to have them in the house. You're our favorite. Oh, and we wish we could buy a dozen of those pink onesie hats that everyone wears. You are our favorite. Oh, and we wish there were more of those hats in the world. You're our favorite. Oh, and we wish we had a dozen of those pink onesie hats in the land. We know we're the only ones that wish, but we wish we had a dozen of those pink onesie hats in the land, too. [Sighs] OK, Richard, we'll give
The whole legal profession is on summer break. We’ll be back in a few weeks with stories and articles about how the hot legal questions of the year are being answered. For now, get caught up on some of the key stories that have been rolling around the web. And continue reading for our picks of the week. Happy reading! And we’ll see you next time. See you then! Bye bye. Now that we’re all off thelaw.com summer break is officially over. So, which summer break products should you be buying? And could they help
Since all even mildly important law people are away on summer vacation, there's not much to do for low-level clerks like Guppy. So Mr. Irwine figured he'd throw a party in Guppy's honor. Of course, he had to invite his own friends first. And his best friend, Sir Galahad, came by to see how things were going. The two of them are good friends since they've known each other since the Middle Ages. Sir Irwine is particularly impressed with Guppy's sovereignty over his own heart: whenever anyone asks him why he's
OK, so Young Smallweed actually has a first name - Bart. Well that's not a real name, but it will do. And that is the name of the character that appears in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. We'll call him Bart for now. Bart's the son of a slave named Benvolio, who we'll come back to. In fact, Benvolio is the only person who knows the true identity of the mysterious Bart. He lets us know that it's not his son, since he also has a son named Volgin. There's a couple more characters with slave names in Shakespe
Tulkinghorn is sitting in his office drinking expensive wine. He is madly in love with his wife, who is also sitting in his office drinking expensive wine. They both look incredibly happy. But then, suddenly, Tulkinghorn is very sad because his wife is leaving him. It's kind of a big deal. Tulkinghorn decides to do something to make amends. He goes to see his old friend, the Mayor of London, who has a really good sense of humor. The Mayor of London tells him that a guy named Cutts is going to be killed in a
When the gang gets back to Bleak House from Casa Boythorn, Esther gets a really unexpected visit from. She finds a little girl who looks and acts just like her. This little girl is huge and has a really funny face. She is indignant at being spoken to and tells Esther that she is a servant and not a daughter. This makes Esther feel pity for this girl. The next day the girl gives a rousing speech about the joys of serving others and a reward for being good. She also tells about how the servants are really hap
Richard is all gung-ho about the army. He goes to his regiment and is welcomed by "a general with a sharp tongue, and a lieutenant who had lost some of his teeth." He also meets other interesting characters. The lieutenant, for instance, is described as a "tall, thin, hardy fellow, with a red spell about his face." The men also hear some music, which they think is "the general's fife". They decide to take a stroll on the moors together. They walk out onto a field, and then the general's horse blocks their p
Ever since all the business with Bucket and Jo, Mr. Tulliver has been depressed. He's no longer the 'clever, witty, and useful member of the Tullivers' group.' He also has a great deal of sadness and disappointment at what he used to be able to do, like being able to make a fire and put it out. But Jo is not worried about him. In fact, she tells him that she's happy to see him in a bad mood. Mr. Tulliver is shocked, because he never expected that Jo would make him feel unhappy. He feels like he's lost his o
Morning time at Mr. Rigg's. Riggs is now a widower and he tells Arthur all about his life. Riggs had a good life, with good friends and always doing the right thing. He was married for a long time, but they never had children. Riggs shares that he has lived in Middlemarch with the Lintons. He loved spending time with them, especially Mary, and they loved him. Everyone in the neighborhood loves him. He has lived in the same house with the Langham girls for ten years. He used to be their gardener, and he woul
The fancy lawyer who wants Captain Hawdon's handwriting sample is. The first lady of the court is. The host is a guy called the Earl of Derby, and he's here to see Lady Chiltern. Okay. The host is really nice. He asks if anyone has any objections to giving the handwriting sample to the lady of the court. Oh, yeah--there is. The guy who has no objections is Captain Wentworth. Everyone except him and the Earl of Derby are against it. The host has a very eloquent speech about how he really only wants to help t
